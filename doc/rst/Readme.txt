Overview

We use the reStructuredText (rST) lightweight markup language to update documentation.

rST files can be edited in any editor, but it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code or Sublime because of rST-specific extensions and packages.
To add a new topic, create a new .rst file to the source folder and add it to the TOC (index.rst).

rST syntax guidelines:

Styles

Keeping consistent styles enables Sphinx to be able to create a proper hierarchy of headings in output files such as PDFs and HTML. Use the styles below when editing your ReST files.

.. code-block::

   Document title
   ##############

   Heading 1
   **********


   Heading 2
   =========

   Heading 3
   ---------

   Heading 4
   ^^^^^^^^^

Cross references (internal links)
To create a cross reference from one page of this document to another page,
ensure that an explicit target is used so that the cross reference is pointing to a unique identifier, rather than a heading that could be repeated somewhere else in the document.

The syntax for explicit targets is as follows:

For the target:

    .. _my-page:

    My Page of Information
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the cross reference:

    To learn more about my information, see :ref:`My Page of Information <my-page>`

Generate rST documentation

When changes to docs are made, you can generate them locally to see how the look like:

1.	Make sure to have Python 3.X installed and the pip package manager.
2.	Install Sphnix to build rst documentation and Read the Docs theme that gives documentation a nice look:
	pip install sphinx
	pip install sphinx_rtd_theme
3.	Generate documentation using the makefile (makefile.bat on Windows or ./Makefile on Linux). The docs are generated into ../source/html folder.

TODO: Update this file

To update GitHub Pages:
1.  got to doc/rst
2.  remove build folder if exist
3.  run makefile.bat on Windows or "make html" on Linux
4.  download gh-pages branch to another directory
5.  remove content from gh-pages branch
6.  copy build/html/* to gh-pages branch
7.  push gh-pages branch to GitHub.
